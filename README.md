Propagate waves through a 2-D velocity model using the spectral element method. These codes are built from the SEMLAB matlab package: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6154-semlab. The code uses 2D spectral-element method to solve the 2D SH wave equation. As a flat Earth approximation is made, this is suitable for ambient noise problems on the order of 500 km or so.

The phase delay field for a given source is estimated via cross-correlation at each point on the map.
